# jupyter-flights

A notebook sample for analyzing flight data from one day in April 2024. 

I used data from the free OpenSky REST API: https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/rest.html
I will not include the data with the project but similar data for [today] can be queried with the CLI. 

I used AI to generate some of this code and conclusions.
