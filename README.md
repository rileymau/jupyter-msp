What are the most popular flight destinations in the world?  What are the most popular continents to fly to?

This notebook models how to answer that question using limited data, from one day in April 2024.  

## Data
I used data from the free OpenSky REST API: https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/rest.html
I will not include the data with the project but similar data can be queried with the CLI. 

## 
I used AI to generate some of this code and conclusions.  AI is useful for fixing syntax, providing syntax for various charts and graphs, troubleshooting code, and can generate conclusions based on data.
